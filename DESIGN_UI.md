# LumaDeck — UI Design

Single source of truth for the plugin's UI. **Rebuilt from scratch**, verified
element by element against the live code. Nothing here is assumed — every entry
is checked in the source before it is written down.

> **Status: IN PROGRESS.** We are walking the QAM (`GameList`) top to bottom.
> Each element is verified and its rule fixed before moving to the next.

## Method

For every element we record four things:

1. **What** — the element and when it appears (always / conditional).
2. **How shown** — the exact component(s) and where in the code.
3. **Native or custom** — 🟢 native Decky · 🟡 native wrapper + custom content ·
   🔴 fully custom — and *why*, if custom.
4. **Rule** — the decision: keep as-is, or how it must be built going forward.

Principles are **derived** from these entries as patterns emerge (see
[§ Principles](#principles-emerging)), not imposed top-down.

---

## QAM — top to bottom

### 0. Plugin header (back · icon · title) — *always* — ✅ verified

- **What:** the panel's top bar: back chevron ‹, the plugin icon, and the title
  **"LumaDeck"**. The very first thing the user sees.
- **How shown:** rendered by **Decky**, not by `GameList`. Comes from
  `definePlugin`'s return in `src/index.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  title: <div className={staticClasses.Title}>LumaDeck</div>,
  icon:  <FaDownload />,
  content: <GameList />,
  ```
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 **Native.** Native QAM header slot + native Steam
  class `staticClasses.Title`. Ours only: the brand text `"LumaDeck"` and the
  icon glyph (`react-icons/fa`).
- **Rule:** Keep. `"LumaDeck"` is the brand string — the one display literal
  allowed without `t()`. Title always uses `staticClasses.Title`; icon always
  from `react-icons/fa`.

### 1. Utility actions (Refresh · Settings) — *always* — ✅ verified

- **What:** the panel's utility actions. Decided home: the **native title bar**,
  not a row inside the content.
- **How shown:** via Decky's **`titleView`** (a custom JSX element in the
  `Plugin` definition that replaces the default header title). In `index.tsx`:
  brand `LumaDeck` (left) + a `Focusable` of two icon `DialogButton`s (right):
  **Refresh** (`FaSync`) and **Settings** (`FaCog`).
  - Refresh and the panel content (`GameList`) are separate React trees, so the
    icon talks to the panel through a tiny bridge (`src/refresh.ts`):
    `GameList` registers `loadGames` via `setRefreshHandler`; the icon calls
    `requestRefresh()`.
  - Settings just navigates: `Navigation.Navigate(ROUTE_SETTINGS)`.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 **Native slot** (`titleView`) with native
  `DialogButton`s (size-only `headerIconStyle`, native focus kept). The
  previous hand-built header row in `content` is **gone** — and with it the
  glow-clipping fight and the "Game manager" subtitle.
- **Rule:**
  - Header actions go in **`titleView`**, never a custom row at the top of
    `content`. Keep it to **1–2 icons** (the title bar is narrow).
  - Title-bar icons use native `DialogButton` with **size-only** styling
    (`headerIconStyle`); never override background/colour/focus.
  - An action that must reach panel state crosses the tree via the
    `src/refresh.ts` bridge pattern, not by lifting state into `index.tsx`.

### 1b. Downloads entry — *always* — ✅ verified

- **What:** entry point to the Downloads page.
- **How shown:** a plain native `ButtonItem` in a trailing `PanelSection` at the
  **very bottom** of the QAM → `Navigation.Navigate(ROUTE_DOWNLOADS)`.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native `ButtonItem`.
- **Rule:** secondary navigation that doesn't fit the 1–2 title-bar icons lives
  as a labelled `ButtonItem`, bottom of the panel.

### 2. Quick Install (onboarding) — *conditional* — ✅ verified

- **What:** the first-run setup entry. Renders **only** when SLSsteam **and**
  CloudRedirect **and** lumalinux are all `not_installed` and headcrab is
  compatible — i.e. a fresh, unconfigured install. It self-hides the moment any
  component is installed (repair/reinstall then lives in Settings).
- **How shown:** `PanelSection title` (i18n) with three rows: an intro text
  `<div>`, a `ButtonItem` (two-click confirm), and a progress text `<div>`
  shown while installing.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native skeleton. The two text rows are raw `<div>`s
  (🔴, but unavoidable — Decky has no text primitive) and they already follow
  the tokens: intro `12px #8b929a`, progress `11px #1a9fff`.
- **Rule:**
  - Onboarding only relevant on a fresh install is **gated on health state**
    and self-hides once configured.
  - Install / destructive actions use the **two-click confirm**: a
    `confirm<Action>` state arms the button (relabel + `description` prompt),
    second press executes.
  - Body text is a plain `<div>` in a `PanelSectionRow` using the text tokens.
    **Step-based** progress is a text line; a `ProgressBar` is only for a real
    percentage.

### 3. Health alerts — *conditional* — ✅ built (v0.3.33)

- **What:** surfaces a broken / degraded **core component** (SLSsteam,
  lumalinux, CloudRedirect). One alert per unhealthy component. Only
  *actionable failures* appear here — `healthy` / `not_installed` are silent
  (install lives in Quick Install / Settings).
- **Current (to be replaced):** a custom orange box (`HealthBanner`) with a
  title, body, and a hand-rolled `<button>` — the worst "red" (non-native
  control, broken gamepad focus, and it looks identical whether or not there's
  an action).
- **Direction (decided — colored box → native rows):**
  - **No colored box.** Each problem is its own **native row**:
    - **Fixable from Game Mode** → **`ButtonItem`**: `icon` = ⚠ in the severity
      colour, `children` = the fix action ("Restart Steam" / "Reinstall …"),
      `description` = the problem. Native focus, the whole row is the button.
    - **Not fixable from Game Mode** → **`Field`**: `icon` = ⚠, `label` = the
      problem, `description` = where/how to fix it (Settings, or Desktop).
      Display-only — **no dead button**.
  - **Severity = the ⚠ icon colour** (warn `#ff8c00`), not a box.
  - **Multiple problems = multiple rows** (one per component), not one stacked
    box.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native (`ButtonItem` / `Field`). Drops the custom
  box *and* the raw `<button>`.
- **Rule:** **never render a button for something you can't do from here.** An
  unactionable alert is a `Field` (info + instructions), not a fake button. The
  exact actionable/not split per state is the table below.

### 3b. Repair architecture — the shared `steam.sh` cascade — ⚠️ correctness

`steam.sh` is **shared**: SLSsteam, CloudRedirect and lumalinux each inject a
block into it. Both the SLSsteam installer (`install_dependencies`) and the
CloudRedirect installer (`install_cloudredirect`) run **headcrab**, which
**regenerates `steam.sh` from scratch** — wiping the *other* components' blocks.
`install_lumalinux` is the exception: it only *patches* (idempotent), so it
never wipes the others, and it must run **last** so its block survives the
headcrab regenerations.

Consequence — a per-component repair that runs headcrab **silently breaks the
others**:

- SLSsteam `injection_missing` repaired with `install_dependencies` alone →
  re-injects SLSsteam but **wipes CloudRedirect + lumalinux**.
- CloudRedirect `broken` repaired with `install_cloudredirect` alone →
  re-injects SLSsteam (headcrab) + CR but **wipes lumalinux**.

**Rule:** any repair that runs headcrab must **re-inject every *installed*
component, in order `SLSsteam → CloudRedirect → lumalinux`** — not a single
installer. This is a dedicated routine, `reinject_installed()` (= `quick_install`
gated on `check_*_installed()`; never installs a component the user doesn't
have). Wire SLSsteam `injection_missing` and CloudRedirect `broken` to it.
`restart` (no `steam.sh` change) and `install_lumalinux` (patch-only) are safe
standalone and stay as-is.

**What `injection_missing`'s repair does, concretely** — `reinject_installed()`:
re-runs SLSsteam (`install_dependencies`) **if installed**, then CloudRedirect
(`install_cloudredirect`) **if installed** (omitted otherwise), then lumalinux
(`install_lumalinux`) **if installed**, in that order — rebuilding a correct
shared `steam.sh`. Each step is gated on `check_*_installed()`, so it only ever
re-injects what the user already had; it never installs a new component.

**`steam.sh` ordering has two reasons, not one.** lumalinux's `install.sh`
*preserves* CloudRedirect's `LD_PRELOAD` (it appends `cloud_redirect.so` rather
than clobbering it) — but only if CR's block is already in `steam.sh` when
lumalinux runs. It **preserves, it does not resurrect** a wiped CR block. So
lumalinux must run after CloudRedirect both (a) so headcrab's regeneration
doesn't wipe lumalinux, and (b) so lumalinux can chain onto CR's freshly
re-added `LD_PRELOAD` (`sls:cr:lumalinux`). The backend's CR detection and the
lumalinux script's preservation work together via this order.

### 3c. Health text spec (normalized, beginner-friendly) — ✅ final

The backend keeps its **granular** states (for logs/diagnostics). The **UI
collapses** the "Steam too new" family into one `unsupported` message per
component, because they share one cause and one fix.

**Why `unsupported` is one state + one fix:** SLSsteam `patterns`/`hash` and
lumalinux `hash_blocked`/`hooks_failed` and CloudRedirect `broken` all mean the
same thing to the user — *Steam updated past what this component supports*. The
fix is the same: **run enter-the-wired in Desktop**, which (via headcrab)
downgrades Steam to the blessed stable build `1782257239` (2026-06-10). Verified
that build is supported by all three: CloudRedirect lists it explicitly
(`SUPPORTED_STEAM_VERSIONS`), it is SLSsteam's headcrab target by definition,
and lumalinux's current hash set covers that era (shared `steamclient.so` hashes
with SLSsteam). It downgrades to an *older stable* build, so even a slightly
lagging component still supports it.

**Render:** each row is `icon` ⚠ (`#ff8c00`) + `label` = *"[Component] —
[impact]"* + `description` = the text below + the control. The component
(technical name) stays, led by the plain-language impact.

**SLSsteam** — impact: *"games won't launch"*

| State (backend) | description | control |
|---|---|---|
| `not_active` | "Not active." | 🔘 **Restart Steam** |
| `injection_missing` | "Not correctly installed." | 🔘 **Repair** → `reinjectInstalled` |
| `unsupported` (= `broken` patterns/hash) | "Unsupported Steam version. Run enter-the-wired in Desktop." | 📄 Field |

**lumalinux** — impact: *"downloads disabled (installed games OK)"*

| State (backend) | description | control |
|---|---|---|
| `not_active` | "Not active." | 🔘 **Restart Steam** |
| `injection_missing` | "Not correctly installed." | 🔘 **Repair** → `install_lumalinux` (patch-only, safe alone) |
| `unsupported` (= `hash_blocked` / `hooks_failed`) | "Unsupported Steam version. Run enter-the-wired in Desktop." | 📄 Field |

**CloudRedirect** — impact: *"cloud saves off"*

| State (backend) | description | control |
|---|---|---|
| `not_active` | "Not active." | 🔘 **Restart Steam** |
| `unsupported` (= `broken`) | "Unsupported Steam version. Run enter-the-wired in Desktop." | 📄 Field |
| `not_authed` | "Sign in via the CloudRedirect app in Desktop." | 📄 Field |

**Wiring notes:**
- **Restart Steam** → `restart_steam` (clean `steam -shutdown`, GM auto-restarts).
- **Repair** → SLSsteam: `reinjectInstalled` (its headcrab wipes the others, so
  re-inject the whole installed set in order). lumalinux: `install_lumalinux`
  alone (patch-only — restores its block, preserves the others; no need to touch
  SLSsteam/CR).
- **Field** rows are display-only (no button); the instruction is in the
  `description`. `unsupported` and `not_authed` are Desktop-only.
- Text drops jargon (`steam.sh`, hooks, patterns, hash, SafeMode) and the
  `hooks_failed` `{0}` hook name (kept in logs only).

### 4. Add Game — mode toggle (By AppID / By name) — ✅ built (v0.3.34)

- **What:** switch the Add Game input between AppID entry and name search; the
  content below follows the selection.
- **How shown:** two native `DialogButton`s in a `Focusable` row. **Focusing**
  one selects its mode (`onFocus`/`onGamepadFocus` → `setAddMode`), so moving
  L/R swaps the content below — native-tab behaviour, but it fits the narrow QAM
  where the native `Tabs` row would look oversized (Tabs is built for full-width
  pages).
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 mostly native — no background/glow override, so the
  **native focus** (white fill) is the only indicator while on the toggle; once
  focus is in the content, the content (AppID field vs search) shows the mode.
  Replaces the old custom segmented control (accent fill + hand-made scale+glow
  focus, which existed only because the fill suppressed native focus).
- **Rule:** for a 2-mode switch with per-mode content in the QAM, prefer
  focus-driven native `DialogButton`s over a custom segmented control or the
  page-sized native `Tabs`. Don't override `background` (it kills native focus);
  let focus + the content below indicate state. No persistent active marker
  needed.
- **Verify on device:** returning *up* from the content should re-focus the
  active mode's button (Decky usually restores last focus within a `Focusable`).
- **No field labels in Add Game:** the tab already names the mode ("By AppID" /
  "By name"), so the AppID and search `TextField`s carry **no `label`** — it
  would be redundant. The active tab is the field's context.

### 4b. Add Game — game info preview — ✅ built

- **What:** the preview shown after a valid AppID — confirms which game you're
  about to add.
- **How shown:** a native **`Field`**: `label` = game name, `description` = a
  trimmed fact line *"dev · size · Metacritic NN · ProtonDB Tier"*. The
  description is a `ReactNode`, so Metacritic and ProtonDB keep their **colour as
  inline text**. `bottomSeparator="standard"`. The slscheevo achievements hint
  stays as a small gold line below.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native `Field`. Replaces the custom `Notice` card +
  hand-made badge pills. The only thing dropped is the card box and the grey
  pills — info is preserved (colour included), and platforms / achievement count
  / PT-BR move to GameDetail.
- **Rule:** a colored badge/pill has no native equivalent, but most "rich card"
  content reduces to a native `Field` (name = label, facts = a `·`-joined
  `description` ReactNode that can colour the meaningful bits). Reach for a
  custom box only when the colour-coded *badge shape* itself is essential.

### 4c. Add Game — alerts (game notices / credentials) — ✅ built

- **What:** notices about the game being added, and a credential warning shown
  at add-time.
- **How shown (native rows, same as Health §3):**
  - **Game notices** (info, no action) → one display-only **`Field`** per note,
    ⚠ gold (`#c8a84b`) icon, the note as the label.
  - **Credential warning** (fixable in Settings) → an actionable **`ButtonItem`**
    "Configure API key" → `Navigation.Navigate(ROUTE_SETTINGS)`, the warning as
    `description`, ⚠ icon in the warning colour. (Health tier-2 pattern.)
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native. Removes the last custom `Notice` cards from
  Add Game — `components/Notice.tsx` is deleted (no remaining users).
- **Scope decision:** only the **Hubcap API key** warning is surfaced here; Ryuu
  is intentionally dropped (not relevant to adding a game).
- **No double ⚠:** the warning text dropped its leading "⚠ " now that the row
  carries an icon.

### 4d. Add Game — action button + download progress — ✅ built

- **Button:** renamed "Download Manifest" → **"Add game"** (`addGameAction`) —
  plain language; the user is adding a game, not downloading a "manifest". The
  `downloadManifest` key stays for the Downloads page's manual button.
- **Progress:** the hand-drawn gradient bar + bytes/speed row → native
  **`ProgressBarWithInfo`** (`nProgress` = percent, `sOperationText` =
  "read / total GB · speed"). Note the `ProgressBar` in `components/ProgressBar.tsx`
  used by the Downloads page is *also* custom — the real native bar is
  `ProgressBarWithInfo` from `@decky/ui` (Downloads can migrate later).
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native progress. The `addStatus` line stays a small
  status text (green/red) above the bar.

### 4e. Add Game — "By name" search & results — ✅ built

- **What:** the name-search path: a search field, a search button, and the
  results list (with a "Show More" affordance).
- **How shown:**
  - Search field → native `TextField` (no label, per §4). Search button →
    native `ButtonItem`.
  - **Results header** → the count is now the **`title` of a nested
    `PanelSection`** (`"12 results"`), i.e. the native Steam section header —
    not a hand-made `<div>`. Each result is a native `ButtonItem` (`label` =
    name, `description` = `AppID: …`).
  - **Show More** → native `ButtonItem` (`+N`), capping the visible list at
    5 → 15.
- **Removed (were raw `<div>`s, never native):**
  - The `"N results — tap to select"` caption `<div>` → folded into the
    `PanelSection title` (just the count; "tap to select" was redundant with the
    button list). `results` i18n trimmed to `"results"`.
  - The `"+N more — refine your search"` footer `<div>` → **deleted** outright
    (once expanded to 15 it was noise). `moreResults` key removed.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 the "By name" path is now `<div>`-free for counts:
  native section header + native result/Show-More buttons.
- **Honest note on tokens vs native:** a `<div>` on the right colour token is
  *still custom* — "on-token" ≠ "native". The only fully-native home for a count
  label is a control slot (`PanelSection title` here); free-floating status text
  (`searchError`, `addStatus`) stays a raw `<div>` because Decky has no text
  primitive — that's the documented, unavoidable exception, marked 🔴, not 🟢.

**Add Game is now box-free:** native tab toggle, label-less fields, info as a
`Field`, alerts as native rows, native progress bar, and a native
`PanelSection`-titled results list (no count `<div>`s).

### 5. My Games — QAM entry — ✅ built

- **What:** the entry point to the full-screen library. My Games **lives on its
  own route** (`ROUTE_LIBRARY`, `Library.tsx`) — the QAM only shows a compact
  launcher entry, not the list.
- **How shown:** a single plain native `ButtonItem` in a **title-less**
  `PanelSection` → `Navigation.Navigate(ROUTE_LIBRARY)`. Same shape as the
  Downloads entry (§1b).
- **Removed:**
  - The `PanelSection title="My Games"` **and** the button label `"My Games"`
    were the *same word stacked twice* (section header + control). Dropped the
    title; the button label carries the name.
  - The manual `" → "` glyph in the label — an arrow typed into the string is
    not a native affordance. A navigating `ButtonItem` needs no arrow; if a
    "goes to a page" hint is ever wanted it's a native `icon`, not a character.
  - The `(N)` count — the full-screen page owns the list, and a count in the QAM
    costs a **full library load** just to render a number. Label is now just
    `t("myGames")`.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native `ButtonItem`, no title, no glyph, no count.
- **Known follow-up (not this section):** the panel **still** loads the whole
  library on mount, because the Sync-all-achievements button (§6) consumes
  `games`. So removing the count did *not* yet make the panel lazy — that only
  lands when §6 is reworked. Documented honestly rather than claimed as a win.
- **Rule:** a navigation entry is **one** plain `ButtonItem`; the label names the
  destination. Never repeat the destination in a section title above it, never
  type arrows into labels, and never put a value in the QAM that forces a data
  load purely to display it.

### 6. Sync Achievements (SLScheevo) — QAM entry — ✅ built

- **What it is:** SLScheevo (third-party, xamionex) generates a game's
  achievement files so Steam recognises them. **Full setup lives on the
  per-game page** (`GameDetail.tsx` → "Achievements" section): download the
  binary, the one-time interactive Steam login (Desktop/Konsole only — Game Mode
  has no terminal), per-game **Generate**, status machine
  (`not_installed` → `not_configured` → `ready`/`generating`/`generated`).
- **What the QAM button does:** *only* the batch shortcut — "generate for **all**
  games at once" (every game with lua + files). It does **not** install or
  configure; it only fires generation with the already-saved login, so it is
  gated on `slscheevoReady` (`check_slscheevo_installed`) and is hidden for users
  without SLScheevo. Decision: **keep it in the QAM** (a whole-library shortcut),
  setup stays in GameDetail.
- **How shown:** native `ButtonItem` in a title-less `PanelSection`; `disabled`
  while running; completion/failure via the native `toaster.toast`.
- **Made native (this pass):** progress was crammed into the **button label**
  (`"Syncing 3/12…"`). `done/total` is a real percentage, and we already use
  `ProgressBarWithInfo` for downloads (§4d) — so the running state is now a
  native **`ProgressBarWithInfo`** below the button (`nProgress` =
  `done/total·100`, `sOperationText` = `"3 / 12"`), and the button label is a
  plain `t("syncingAchievements")` ("Syncing achievements…"). The
  `syncingAchievements` key dropped its `{0}/{1}` placeholders (the count lives
  in the bar now).
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 fully native — `ButtonItem` + native progress bar +
  native toast. No `<div>`.
- **Rule:** a discrete-count batch with a known total uses a native
  `ProgressBarWithInfo` (real `done/total` percentage), not a count stuffed into
  a button label. The button label is the *action/idle* text only.
- **Known follow-up (carried from §5):** this is the QAM's **last** consumer of
  the full `games` list. Moving the batch to the My Games full-screen page would
  finally let the panel skip the library load — deferred, not done.

---

## Full-screen pages — top to bottom

The QAM is a launcher; space-hungry views live on their own routes
(`routerHook.addRoute` in `index.tsx`): **Library** (My Games), **GameDetail**,
**Settings**, **Downloads**. (`Help` is no longer a standalone page — see §7.)

### 7. Library (My Games) — full-screen — ✅ built

- **What:** the full games list, reached from the QAM's My Games button
  (`ROUTE_LIBRARY`). Builds its own list from `getInstalledLuaScripts` (so every
  row is a lua-managed game) and polls `getActiveDownloads` for live phase.
- **Container — was `SidebarNavigation` with ONE page → now a plain page.** A
  single-page sidebar renders a left rail with one item next to the content —
  pure overhead. Library is now a plain scrollable page
  (`<div style={{marginTop:40, height:'calc(100% - 40px)', overflowY:'scroll'}}>`
  + the `PanelSection`). This also removes the **doubled "My Games"** (the
  sidebar page title *and* the `PanelSection` title were the same string) — only
  the section title remains. *(Downloads still uses a 1-page `SidebarNavigation`;
  same treatment pending when we reach it.)*
- **Sort control removed.** A `ButtonItem` that **cycled** A-Z → AppID → Recent
  on each tap was low-discoverability custom interaction. For a personal list,
  type-to-filter (the `TextField`) + a fixed A-Z sort is enough. Dropped the
  button, `sortMode` state and the `sort` i18n key.
- **`GameCard` — colour dot removed, dead progress bar removed:**
  - The hand-built 8px coloured status **dot** (`<div>`+`<span>` flex) is gone.
    State is already named by the row's coloured `description` text, so the dot
    was redundant. Card is now `ButtonItem` `children = {name}`, `description =`
    a single coloured `<span>` (`installed`/`manifest only`/`disabled` +
    `— appid`), colour kept (green `#00cc00` / amber `#ffaa00` / blue `#1a9fff`
    while a phase is active).
  - The custom **`ProgressBar`** branch was **dead code**:
    `downloadProgress`/`downloadTotal` were never assigned anywhere (Library only
    sets the phase string). Steam does the actual download natively — there are
    no bytes for the plugin to show — so the bar never rendered. Removed the
    branch, the two fields and the `ProgressBar` import. The **phase text**
    (`Installing…`, `Configuring…`, `Restarting Steam…`) stays — that's real
    post-download lumalinux work, shown as the coloured `description`.
  - Reachable states here: **Installed** (green, `· ★` if achievements),
    **Manifest only** (amber), **Disabled** (amber), **Downloading/phase**
    (blue). The grey **Pending** (no-lua) branch is **unreachable** in Library
    (every row has lua by construction) — kept in the component only for reuse.
- **`Help` relocated.** `Help.tsx` was a fully-built page wired to **nothing**
  (no route, no import). Its content is general plugin help, so it now lives as
  a **page in the Settings sidebar** (`HelpContent`, no back button — the sidebar
  owns navigation). `Help.tsx` exports `HelpContent`; `Settings.tsx` adds a
  `FaQuestionCircle` "Help" page after About.
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 plain native page — `PanelSection` + `TextField` +
  native `ButtonItem` rows (`GameCard`). Remaining `<div>`s are the
  loading/empty status lines (free-floating text, on-token) and the page's
  scroll wrapper (structural, not decorative).
- **Rule:** a single-list route is a **plain scrollable page**, not a 1-page
  `SidebarNavigation`. Don't ship cycle-through controls where a filter or a
  `Dropdown` fits. Never render UI for data that no longer exists (the native
  Steam download killed per-game byte progress — delete it, don't leave it
  guarded-but-dead). A built page wired to nothing is either routed or deleted —
  Help was rehomed.

### 8. GameDetail — full-screen, 6-page `SidebarNavigation` — 🚧 in progress

The per-game page (`ROUTE_GAME_DETAIL/:appid`). **`SidebarNavigation` is
justified here** — it has six genuine sections: Status, Download, Game
Management, Achievements, Fixes, Uninstall. Reviewed page by page.

**`ActionButton` is fine (not custom chrome).** Used across the page, it's just a
native `ButtonItem` with a colour-tinted label (`danger` red `#ff4444`,
`primary` blue `#1a9fff`) — matches the "coloured text in a control slot"
principle. Kept as-is.

**Decided in advance (boxes, when we reach their pages):**
- *Uninstall* red box → **native**: the destructive list becomes a `Field`
  (label + `·` list in the description); severity is already carried by the red
  `danger` button, the two-click confirm, and the page literally titled
  "Uninstall". No hand-bordered box.
- *SLScheevo path* code box → **simplify**: you can't copy it (Game Mode has no
  clipboard to Konsole), so it's reference text, not a copy affordance. Keep a
  legible monospace line, drop the dark bordered "code block" framing.

#### 8a. Status page — ✅ built

- **What:** read-only summary — AppID, install status (+ size), install path.
- **Was:** three raw `<div>`s (`AppID: …`, `Status: …` coloured, the path).
- **Now:** native `Field` rows —
  - `Field label="AppID"` → value on the right (AppID is a technical literal used
    across the codebase, not display prose, so no `t()` — consistent with
    GameCard / search results).
  - `Field label={t("gameStatus")}` → coloured status value as children
    (green installed / amber manifest-only / grey not-installed, `+ size`), with
    the **install path as the Field's `description`** sub-line (one Field does
    both; no separate path `<div>`).
- **"Not installed" state removed.** It required `hasLua === false`, but every
  game reachable here arrives from My Games (which only lists lua-managed games),
  so `hasLua` is always true on entry — the only false instant is the ~1.5s flash
  after Uninstall before `NavigateBack()`. So the status row is gated on `hasLua`
  (hidden in that flash) and collapses to two real states: **Installed** (green,
  has files) / **Manifest only** (amber, config but no files). Dropped the
  `notInstalled` i18n key. (Same "delete the unreachable state" call as
  GameCard's grey *Pending*.)
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native `Field`s; the only inline style left is the
  status **colour** on the value `<span>` (a control-slot child, allowed).
- **Rule:** read-only "label: value" info is a native `Field` (label + value
  child), not a `Label: value` `<div>`. A secondary detail (a path) rides as the
  Field `description` rather than spawning its own row. Don't render states the
  navigation can't reach.

#### 8b. Download page — ✅ built (v0.3.52)

- **What:** start/cancel a download, auto-update toggle, and the in-flight
  status + result/warning messages.
- **Was:** half-native. The structure (`PanelSection`/`PanelSectionRow`), the
  `ToggleField` (auto-update) and the `ActionButton`s were already native; the
  custom chrome was a raw status `<div>`, the custom `ProgressBar` component, two
  hand-bordered orange warning boxes (stuck update, hubcap-key-expired), and two
  raw coloured `<div>`s for done/failed.
- **Now:**
  - **Status line + bar → one native `ProgressBarWithInfo`.** The phase label,
    `API:`, byte counter and speed all ride in `sOperationText`; `nProgress` is
    the byte ratio. `indeterminate` for phases with no measurable total
    (processing/installing/configuring/…). Same pattern as the QAM download bar.
  - **`depot_download` branch deleted.** Dead DDL path (backend no longer runs
    it); the status-label map and the bar no longer reference it.
  - **Stuck-update box → one native actionable `ButtonItem`** (⚠ amber icon,
    `label` = title, `description` = body + key hint, children = "Fix Update",
    `onClick` = re-download). Collapses the old box + separate Fix-Update button
    into one row. **No "open game" action** — we're already in GameDetail.
  - **Hubcap-key-expired box → one native actionable `ButtonItem`** (⚠ amber,
    `onClick` → Settings, where the Hubcap key lives). Same shape as GameList's
    `credWarnings` row.
  - **done / failed → native `Field`** (green child for "complete"; ⚠ red icon +
    error in `description` for failed).
- **Native or custom:** 🟢 native; only inline style left is the status **colour**
  on the "complete" `<span>` child (allowed control-slot colour).
- **Rule:** in-progress work is a native `ProgressBarWithInfo` (text in
  `sOperationText`, never a sibling `<div>`); a warning that has a fix is an
  actionable `ButtonItem` with a `FaExclamationTriangle` icon, not a
  hand-bordered box. Reuse the established native warning shape; don't re-skin it.

## Component model — system status (errors + updates) — 🚧 BUILDING (steps 1–5 done)

> Progress: **1** `get_components_status()` ✅ · **2** `apply_component()` ✅ ·
> **3** one fetch + `SystemStatus` renderer (5-action collapse + update track),
> old builders/banners deleted ✅ · **4** Stuck into the renderer ✅ (folded into
> step 3) · **5** Desktop autostart for the downgrade ✅ (v0.3.50 — the "Fix in
> Desktop" row arms a one-shot autostart that runs enter-the-wired + lumalinux
> re-inject in Desktop and auto-returns to Game Mode) · **6** i18n cleanup (drop
> the now-unused per-component update strings) — pending.

> Supersedes the split **Health banner (§3)** + **Updates banner**. Both collapse
> into one data model and one renderer. This is the authoritative spec; §3/§3b/§3c
> remain valid for the *text* and *cascade* rules, but the rendering and fetching
> described there are replaced by this.

### Why
Today SLSsteam, lumalinux and CloudRedirect each live in four places (health,
update, row builder, action) with the `steam.sh` cascade knowledge copied into
every button. Three components × four concerns = a tangle. They are the **same
kind of thing** — a *managed component* — so we unify them.

### The components
- **Core** = **SLSsteam + lumalinux**. They go together; one without the other is
  a broken state, fixed by reinstalling the pair.
- **Optional** = **CloudRedirect**. Add-on; its absence is not an error.
- **Plugin** = **LumaDeck** itself. Special: its "fix" and its "update" are the
  same manual action (download zip, install via Decky ▸ Developer ▸ Install from
  ZIP).

### Backend (two new pieces, wrapping what exists)

**1. `get_components_status()` — one fetch, uniform shape.** Composes the existing
`read_*_health` + the update checks. Replaces the 8 fetches / 7 React states:
```
{
  components: [ { id, name, installed, health, update:{installed,latest,available} }, ... ],
  headcrab:   { compatible, target, current },   // compat gate ONLY (see below)
  plugin:     { installed, latest, available },
}
```
New real check: `check_slssteam_update` + a CR check, both **via h3adcr-b**
(see Updates). `headcrabCompat` goes back to being *only* the compat gate — the
fake "SLSsteam update derived from `!compatible`" is deleted.

**2. `apply_component(id, op)` — one cascade-safe action.** `op ∈ {install,
repair, update}`. Does the op, then **always** runs `reinject_installed()` (which
already re-injects every *installed* component in order SLSsteam → CloudRedirect →
lumalinux). The UI never knows the `steam.sh` ordering. `reinject_installed`
already exists and already gates on `check_*_installed()`.

### Compatibility contract (how updates stay safe)
The whole set is anchored to **h3adcr-b's pinned Steam build**
(`HeadcrabCompatibleClientVer`). Deadboy666 curates the bundle (Steam pin +
SLSsteam `latest` + CloudRedirect `linux-test` `.so`) to be mutually compatible
at the **weakest-link** Steam build, so headcrab never lands you on a Steam that
breaks SLSsteam or CR. **lumalinux is outside headcrab** and self-validates via
its `steamclient.so` hash check (`hash_blocked`). Three safety layers:
1. Updates are **gated on `headcrab.compatible === true`** (Steam at the pin).
2. lumalinux's hash check refuses silently-incompatible builds (`hash_blocked`).
3. After `apply_component`, re-fetch status to confirm all healthy.

### ERRORS → the user can only ever do 5 things

| # | User action | Backend states it covers | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Restart Steam** | `not_active` (any component) | Game Mode |
| 2 | **Repair component** (install + restart) | `injection_missing` (SLS/luma), `hooks_failed` (luma), `broken`→reinstall (CR, Steam OK), core half-installed | Game Mode |
| 3 | **Downgrade Steam** | "Steam too new": `broken`/`hash_blocked` (cross-ref headcrab) | Desktop |
| 4 | **Configure cloud provider** | CR `not_authed` | Desktop |
| 5 | **Install LumaDeck manually** | plugin needs the zip | manual |

Silent: `healthy`, CR `kill_switched` (`~/.config/CloudRedirect/disable`, a
deliberate opt-out the plugin only *detects*, never creates), CR `not_installed`.

**Collapse / cross-reference rules (why the user sees little):**
- **"Steam too new" is ONE row** even when 3 components report it
  (`broken`/`broken`/`hash_blocked`). Cross-ref `headcrab.compatible` to confirm
  it's a downgrade and not a plain reinstall.
- **Same cause across components = one row** (two `not_active` → one "Restart").
- **Core (SLS+luma) is evaluated as one unit**; CR separate, only if installed.
- **Priority:** action 3 (downgrade) **supersedes** 1 and 2 (nothing works until
  Steam is right). Show the single highest-priority row; the next surfaces once
  it's resolved.
- **lumalinux `hash_blocked` is conditional:** it joins the downgrade group ONLY
  if SLS/CR also report "Steam too new" (then the headcrab pin is in lumalinux's
  hash set and it recovers too). If lumalinux is blocked **alone**, headcrab
  can't help (it doesn't know about lumalinux) → it's a **lumalinux update**
  problem, not a downgrade.

**Two Desktop actions (3 and 4) — why they can't run in Game Mode:**
- **Downgrade (3):** the Steam roll-back is a multi-restart op; even with our
  Game-Mode-safe headcrab patches the failure mode is a wiped Steam, so it stays
  Desktop. Delivered via a **one-shot autostart** in `~/.config/autostart/`: from
  Game Mode we write the script + `.desktop`, switch to Desktop, it runs on login
  (in a visible Konsole), then self-removes. The "order" persists on disk.
- **CR login (4):** the provider sign-in is a GUI flow inside the CloudRedirect
  Flatpak; Game Mode can't drive arbitrary Flatpak windows. Genuinely
  Desktop-only unless CR adds a headless/token login.

### UPDATES → a separate track (not folded into "repair")

Mechanically an update is "(re)install + restart" like a repair, but for the user
it's **optional/info**, not a problem — so it renders as a distinct (blue) track,
not as a ⚠ fix.

| Component | Update check | Apply | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **lumalinux** | latest release of its repo vs installed | `install_lumalinux` + reinject | light |
| **SLSsteam** | hash of the `latest` asset (**via h3adcr-b**) vs installed `.so` | re-run headcrab + reinject | heavy |
| **CloudRedirect** | hash/ETag of `linux-test/cloud_redirect.so` (**via h3adcr-b**) vs installed `.so` | re-run headcrab + reinject | heavy |
| **LumaDeck** | latest plugin release | download zip → message "Decky ▸ Developer ▸ Install from ZIP, then restart Steam" | manual |

Rules:
- **CR has no semver of its own** — its "version" *is* which `linux-test` `.so`
  you have, so the check is a **hash/ETag compare against the exact asset headcrab
  installs** (the current `checkCloudredirectUpdate` semver check is wrong and is
  removed).
- **All updates gated on `headcrab.compatible`**; the set updates **together**
  (one reinject at the end); re-check health after.
- SLSsteam/CR "update" = re-running the headcrab install, which is **safe in Game
  Mode when Steam is already at the pin** (no downgrade happens).

---

### Two tracks the user sees
- **"Something's wrong" (⚠):** at most one of the 5 fixes, by priority.
- **"Something's new" (info):** the update track.

Normally the user sees **nothing, or one row**. The full per-component breakdown
(versions, individual install/repair/update) lives in **Settings ▸ Dependencies**
for the advanced 1%.

### What gets deleted
- The 3 near-identical health row builders (`slssProblem`/`llProblem`/`crProblem`)
  → one generic mapper.
- `UpdatesBanner` (absorbed into the single renderer).
- The fake "SLSsteam update" derived from `!headcrabCompat.compatible`.
- The misleading `checkCloudredirectUpdate` semver check → hash compare.
- Per-button cascade wiring → owned by `apply_component`.

### Implementation order (incremental, each step builds + ships)
1. Backend `get_components_status()` wrapping existing health/update fns + real
   `check_slssteam_update` + CR hash check. (Adds only; nothing visible changes.)
2. Backend `apply_component()` over `reinject_installed`.
3. Frontend: one fetch, one renderer (the 5-fix collapse + update track); delete
   the 3 builders + `UpdatesBanner`.
4. Move **Stuck** (per-game `UpdateResult=8`) into the same problem renderer,
   action "Open game".
5. The Desktop autostart for the downgrade (action 3).
6. i18n cleanup + normalized strings.

## Principles (emerging)

- The brand string `"LumaDeck"` is the only hard-coded display literal; every
  other user-facing string goes through `t()`, added to **both** `en` and
  `pt-BR`.
- Icons come from `react-icons/fa` only.
- **Header actions** live in the native `titleView` (1–2 icons), not a custom
  row in `content`. Native `DialogButton`, size-only styling, native focus.
- **Text tokens observed so far** (inline hex, no CSS framework):
  | Role | Value |
  |---|---|
  | Primary text | `#dcdedf` |
  | Secondary / muted | `#8b929a` |
  | Accent / progress | `#1a9fff` |
  - Sizes: `12px` standard body, `11px` secondary sub-line.
- **Two-click confirm** is the standard for install/destructive actions
  (`confirm<Action>` state + `ButtonItem` `description`).
- Raw `<div>`s for text are expected (no native text component); keep them on
  the tokens above rather than inventing new colours/sizes. **But "on-token" is
  not "native":** a styled `<div>` is still 🔴 custom. Before accepting one, ask
  whether the text is really a *label* — counts, captions and section headers
  belong in a native control slot (`PanelSection title`, `Field` label, button
  `description`). Only genuinely free-floating status text (`searchError`,
  `addStatus`, install progress) has no native home and stays a `<div>`.
- **Alerts map to native controls by nature**, not one colored box: actionable
  → `ButtonItem` (message in `description`, action in the label); pure info →
  `Field` (`icon` + `label`/`description`); only genuinely rich content (a
  badge grid) keeps a custom container. Severity is carried by a **coloured
  icon**, not a box.
- **Never render a control (button) for something that can't act from the
  current context.** Show it as display (`Field`) with instructions instead.
- Native **text lives in control slots**: `label` / `description` of
  `ButtonItem`/`Field`, `title` of `PanelSection`. Only *free-floating* text
  needs a raw `<div>`.
